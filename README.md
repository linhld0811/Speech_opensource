## VAD:

## Speech Enhancement
### I. Open Source:
1. [CleanUnet](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CleanUNet/tree/main)
### II. Metric
1. [STOI](https://github.com/mpariente/pystoi): <br>
- Short-Time Objective Intelligibility Measure: is calculated by comparing the short-term power spectra of the noisy speech and the clean speech. <br>
- The correlation between the two spectra is then used to calculate the STOI score. <br>
- It is based on the idea that intelligibility can be measured by the correlation between the noisy speech and the clean speech.
- Higher STOI scores indicate better intelligibility.
2. [PESQ](https://github.com/ludlows/PESQ): <br>
- Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality is calculated by comparing the noisy speech and the clean speech using a listening test. <br>
- The results of the listening test are then used to calculate the PESQ score. <br>
- It is based on the idea that speech quality can be measured by how well the listener can understand the speech and how pleasant it sounds.  <br>
- Higher PESQ scores indicate better quality.
## TTS
### I. Open Source
### II. Metric
1. [NISQA](https://github.com/gabrielmittag/NISQA):
MOS - Mean Opinion Score
2. [MCD](https://github.com/MattShannon/mcd):
- Mel cepstral distortion (MCD) is a measure of how different two sequences of mel cepstra are.
- The smaller the MCD between synthesized and natural mel cepstral sequences, the closer the synthetic speech is to reproducing natural speech.
